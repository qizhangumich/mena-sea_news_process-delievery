# SEA News Processing and Delivery System

This repository contains scripts for collecting and delivering SEA news articles via email.

## Security Setup

### Required Secrets

The following secrets need to be set up in GitHub Actions:

1. `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
2. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Base64 encoded Firebase service account key
3. `SMTP_USERNAME`: SMTP2Go username
4. `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP2Go password
5. `EMAIL_FROM`: Sender email address
6. `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS`: Comma-separated list of recipient email addresses

### Local Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with the following structure:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SMTP_USERNAME=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
EMAIL_FROM=your_email@domain.com
EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=recipient1@domain.com,recipient2@domain.com
```

2. Place your Firebase service account key file in the root directory:
